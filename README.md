# Eat-da-Burger

This application was created with MySQL, Node, Express, and Handlebars. The user inputs the name of a burger he/she would like to eat, then a burger list is populated on the left side of the screen. Besides each burger entered by the user,  a "devour it!" button is displayed. When the user clicks on the button a devoured list is displayed on the right side of the screen.
